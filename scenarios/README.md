- Tune existing rules
- Create hunting queries
- Develop investigation workflows
- Design response playbooks

### Investigation Scenarios
- Multi-stage attacks
- Complex timelines
- Multiple data sources
- Entity correlation
- Root cause analysis

## Scenario Format

Each scenario should include:
- **Attack Overview** - Description of the attack
- **Attack Steps** - Detailed attack timeline
- **Detection Challenge** - What to detect and how
- **Investigation Guide** - How to investigate
- **Response Actions** - Recommended response
- **Key Learnings** - Important takeaways
